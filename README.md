# 📚 Book Dataset SQL Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using a publicly available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset), this project gave me the opportunity to apply SQL for data analysis and practice data cleaning, modelling, and querying.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset)
- **Files included:**
  - `Books.csv` – Metadata about books (title, author, publisher, etc.)
  - `Users.csv` – Basic user demographics (location, age, etc.)
  - `Ratings.csv` – User ratings of books (explicit and implicit)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL for data cleaning, joining, and analysis

## 📈 What I Did

- Cleaned and normalized the dataset for easier querying
- Varies analysis to gather insights

## 📊 Key Insights

-  The most rated books were often not the highest-rated ones, suggesting popularity doesn't always mean quality
-  Original data had multiple data quality issues such as impossible ages, blank spaces, N/A / 0 values etc
-  Original data sets were well constructed and easy to join

## 🤔 What I Learned

- How to import data into a database with the correct data types
- How to structure and clean real-world datasets using SQL
- How to use SQL joins and aggregations effectively
- The importance of handling NULLs and duplicates
- Data storytelling through queries and logical conclusions in the form of analyst comments

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repo
2. Import the CSV files from 'raw_data' into your SQL database
3. Run the SQL scripts starting from 'data cleaning' folder followed by 'analytics' folder
